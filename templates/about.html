<h1>About The Project</h1>
<h3>What the hell is going on here?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked! So, there's this dope lil' video made by a fella named Super Eyepatch Wolf. It's a look into
the history of Garfield as a cultural icon, with an emphasis on his online presence. In the video, SEW decides to read
like a thousand strips to determine what the most common Garfield joke is. Problem being, well, there's 16,000+
strips. This site aims to complete that data. Through the power of the internet, we can TRULY determine the most
common Garfield joke!</p>
<h3>Okay, but why?</h3>
<h4>Let me have this.</h4>
<h3>How are you keeping track of all this?</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JF8rXb1KKFqjRYwXqbvBgAYzKmMIpoed1Y4K5aNEFSA/edit?usp=sharing">You can find the spreadsheet here.</a>
    Every time you submit a response, the relevant joke counter is incremented by
 one. Since a lot of these strips might have multiple responses for what the joke is, I've got two options: I either
 take the mode of an individual strip, or I let every response matter. Only time will tell which one I use.</p>
<h3>Anything I can do to help?</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Submit responses during your free time! Submit to Garfield. Also, if you chuckled at the site idea,
