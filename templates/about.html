<h2>About The Project</h2>
<h3>What the hell is going on here?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked! So, there's this dope lil' video made by a fella named Super Eyepatch Wolf. It's a look into
the history of Garfield as a cultural icon, with an emphasis on his online presence. In the video, SEW decides to read
like a thousand strips to determine what the most common Garfield joke is. Problem being, well, there's like 14,000+
strips. This site aims to complete that data. Through the power of the internet, we can TRULY determine the most
common Garfield joke!</p>
<h3>Okay, but why?</h3>
<h4>Let me have this.</h4>
<h3>Anything I can do to help?</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Submit responses during your free time! Submit to Garfield. Also, if you chuckled at the site idea,
  toss me a bone! Never expected, but I could use a coffee!</p>
